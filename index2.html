      <li> cut up the lemons into thin slices </li>
      <li> get a jar (preferably made out of glass) </li>
      <li> put the lemon slices in the jar and put honey in between the layers </li>
      <li> put in fridge for next uses </li>
    </ol>
    <p> basically you need to keep the jar in the fridge for a few days/weeks so that the honey gets absorded into the lemon slices. If you make it correctly, you can even eat the lemon slices after you make the tea because the rind would be sweet. We're basically making candied lemon except healthy and good for your throat. My mom makes me this honey lemon tea when I'm sick. </p>
    <h4> how to use the honey lemon slices </h4>
    <p> you boil some water and put some lemon slices in it and BAM, honey lemon tea. For better results, there will be some amazing nectar at the bottom of the jar (result of honey and lemon juice). Scoop some of that and put it into the water, honey lemon tea upgrade 500%. </p>
